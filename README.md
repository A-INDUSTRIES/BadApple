# BadApple but as an overlay
### (only white pixels are displayed)

## How to run:
If you already have rust installed on your system it is as easy as:\
`cargo run --release`\
Otherwise head over to the [latest release](\https://github.com/A-INDUSTRIES/BadApple/releases/latest) to download the app (with all files needed)
#### When running if you want to quit, you can `CTRL-C` in terminal.
If you run the app without a terminal (which I recommend),\
to quit you will have to make appear the `ALT-TAB` menu and close the window from there.
#### This app has only been tested on windows.
